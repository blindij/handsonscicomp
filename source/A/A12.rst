About Windows
-------------

Windows is perhaps the most common operating system for desktop
computers, but historically hasn't been that common or good for
scientific work.  However, this is changing and these days you can do
a lot of good stuff with Windows if you set it up right.  We'll walk
through it here.


Shell tools
-----------

Windows comes with CMD (cmd.exe) known as command prompt. You can find CMD by typing "cmd" in your start menu search bar. 
A slightly better alternative would be a Git bash command line because Windows command prompt does not support many UNIX commands.
Git Bash emulates a bash environment and lets you use all git features plus most of standard unix commands.

To install Git Bash and *nix environment tools, follow `this <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=339AEqk9c-8>`_ tutorial made by Software Carpentry.
Links for installations showing in video:

* `Git Bash <https://gitforwindows.org>`_
* `Software Carpentry Windows installer <https://github.com/swcarpentry/windows-installer/releases/download/v0.3/SWCarpentryInstaller.exe>`_
* `Software Carpentry Windows installer documentation <https://github.com/swcarpentry/windows-installer/blob/master/README.md>`_


Version control (git)
---------------------

* through Anaconda
* ... or download: https://git-scm.com/download/win ?



Anaconda (Python)
-----------------

There are very many programming languages, and you probably won't only
use Python.  But, it is quite common so we mention it here.  We
install the Anaconda distribution of Python: it gets you all the basic
things you need, and can also install R and other programming
languages, too.  Anaconda is large and has all the most common things
people need - if you want to save space, install Miniconda instead
(then you have to decide what extra packages you want).

   We need to give details about how to use it.



Editor
------

For IDE (Integrated development environment): Visual Studio Code by Microsoft is a free source code editor.
It offers customizable functionalities for a more advanced user but is simple enough for a beginner to start with. 
Install and learn more `here <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows>`_.

Other good alternative for Windows is Notepad++ source code and text editor. Notepad++ is not exactly an IDE as it lacks
features that IDEs have but plugins are available to add functionalities. Download and read more `here <https://notepad-plus-plus.org>`_.


Jupyter
-------

`Jupyter <https://jupyter.org>`_ is an interactive way to explore
data.  It's already installed along with Anaconda.
