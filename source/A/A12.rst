About Windows
-------------

Windows is perhaps the most common operating system for desktop
computers, but historically hasn't been that common or good for
scientific work.  However, this is changing and these days you can do
a lot of good stuff with Windows if you set it up right.  We'll walk
through it here.


Shell tools

Version control (git)
---------------------

* through Anaconda
* ... or download: https://git-scm.com/download/win ?



Anaconda (Python)
-----------------

There are very many programming languages, and you probably won't only
use Python.  But, it is quite common so we mention it here.  We
install the Anaconda distribution of Python: it gets you all the basic
things you need, and can also install R and other programming
languages, too.  Anaconda is large and has all the most common things
people need - if you want to save space, install Miniconda instead
(then you have to decide what extra packages you want).

* `Anaconda <https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install>`_
* `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_
