MacOS became popular for scientific work when it became based on Unix:
it provided an easy interface *and* the shell, which is a great
combination.

This page gets you set up for basic scientific work using Python.

Shell tools
-----------

Mac comes with the bash (or zsh for 10.15 and later), so you don't
need to do anything.  Just start it by TODO.  To verify, try running
this::

  echo $SHELL


Version control (git)
---------------------

You install Git for MacOS by downloading the most recent "mavricks"
installer from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/

Nothing appears in Applications, since it's a command line program.
From

Verify it from the shell terminal::

  git --version



Anaconda (Python)
-----------------

There are very many programming languages, and you probably won't only
use Python.  But, it is quite common so we mention it here.  We
install the Anaconda distribution of Python: it gets you all the basic
things you need, and can also install R and other programming
languages, too.  Anaconda is large and has all the most common things
people need - if you want to save space, install Miniconda instead
(then you have to decide what extra packages you want).

* `Anaconda <https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install>`_
* `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_

This will get you Jupyter and many other Python things, too.

Jupyter
-------

`Jupyter <https://jupyter.org>`_ is an interactive way to explore
data.  It's already installed along with Anaconda.
